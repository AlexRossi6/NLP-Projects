Little touches like the band going into a café and ordering \"Corn-Flakes mit Milch.\" My favourite scene, which does have some bassis in fact, is where at an audition Stuart Sutcliffe has just bought his bass guitar but can\\'t play it, so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries faking it, but gets caught.
